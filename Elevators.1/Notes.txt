    // basic logic
    //
    // Open their door if there is a rider to disembark
    // Disembark a rider if the door is open and there's a rider who wants to get off
    // board a rider if the door is open and a rider wants to board
    // hold the door open for a few seconds more in case more riders show up
    // after waiting a few seconds, and there are riders on the elevator, close the door and get moving
    // if the elevator is already between floors, keep moving -- stop at a floor if its panel button is pressed
    // if an elevator is idle and the up/down button is pressed, open the door for the rider to board
    // if there's a floor with a lit up/down button, close the door and start moving there
    // close the door and go idle
    // this is an if/else if/else strucure


    // riders
    // 
    // riders have references to their starting floor, and their floor destination
    // can communicate where they are and where they're going
    // can determine if they need to go up or down
    // upon arrival rider exits simulation (disappears)

    // Floors
    //
    // elevation (inches above ground)
    // name (ex. mezzanine)
    // abbreviated label for their name as appears on button
    // a queue of riders waiting for an up-going elevator
    // a queue of riders wating for a down-going elevator
    // a panel with two buttons for riders to press for going up or going down

    //floors can add and remove riders from their up/down rider queues
    // floors know their elevation and compare themselves to other floors and elevators to determine if above or below
